## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a React component?
  Components are like JavaScript functions. They accept arbitrary inputs (called “props”) and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen. They are the building blocks of React applications and can be composed together to create complex UIs.

- How do you define a component in React?

1. Export the component (export default)
2. Define the function (function FunctionName() {}) - not camelCase, but with Bookcase for the name of the function to be read by JSX and React

- How is a component "rendered" (made visible on the browser page)?
  import to the main app component (e.g. import CustomButton from './CustomButton')
  import the component created into the file you are trying to import to
