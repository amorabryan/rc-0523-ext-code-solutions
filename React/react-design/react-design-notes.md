## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What are the phases in the React design process?

1. Initialization - the main component is being created with its initial state and props.
2. Mounting - the component is added to the DOM and rendered.
3. Updating - the component re-renders when its props or states change.
4. Unmounting - the component is removed from the DOM

- How does data flow in React?

  The data flows from parent to child, or unidirectional data flow. The data transfer cannot go from child to parent.

- How can children components modify state in their parents?

  We can set the parent state from the children component in function components by passing the state handle function as a prop of the child component.
